    "\n",
    "Switzerland, a landlocked country in the heart of Europe, has a rich and fascinating history that spans thousands of years. From its early inhabitants in prehistoric times to its development as a neutral and prosperous nation, Switzerland’s story is one of resilience, cooperation, and independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early History and Roman Influence\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest known inhabitants of what is now Switzerland were prehistoric tribes, including the Celts, who settled in the region around 1500 BCE. One of the most significant Celtic tribes, the Helvetii, occupied much of present-day Switzerland. However, their attempt to migrate westward in 58 BCE was thwarted by the Roman general Julius Caesar, who incorporated the region into the Roman Empire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under Roman rule, Switzerland became a vital part of the empire’s infrastructure, with well-developed roads, cities, and trade routes. Roman settlements such as Aventicum (modern-day Avenches) and Augusta Raurica flourished. The region remained under Roman control until the empire’s decline in the 5th century CE, when Germanic tribes, including the Alemanni and Burgundians, migrated into the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Middle Ages and the Formation of the Confederation\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Middle Ages, Switzerland was divided among feudal lords and bishops, including the powerful Habsburg family. However, Swiss communities, particularly those in mountainous areas, sought to maintain autonomy from these rulers. On August 1, 1291, three cantons—Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden—formed a defensive alliance known as the Swiss Confederation, marking the traditional founding of Switzerland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next two centuries, the confederation expanded as other regions joined the alliance, and Swiss forces won decisive battles against Habsburg rule, including the Battle of Morgarten (1315) and the Battle of Sempach (1386). By the late 15th century, the Swiss had established a reputation for military prowess, with Swiss mercenaries being highly sought after across Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reformation and the Swiss Neutrality Tradition\n",
    "\n",
    "The 16th century saw the rise of the Protestant Reformation, which deeply affected Switzerland. Reformers such as Ulrich Zwingli in Zurich and John Calvin in Geneva played key roles in shaping Protestant theology and politics. However, religious divisions also led to internal conflicts, as different cantons adhered to either Protestantism or Catholicism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switzerland’s policy of neutrality began to take shape during the 17th century, particularly after the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648). The Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 formally recognized Switzerland’s independence from the Holy Roman Empire, solidifying its status as a neutral entity in European affairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Napoleonic Era and the Birth of Modern Switzerland\n",
    "\n",
    "During the late 18th century, Switzerland was affected by the French Revolution and Napoleon’s expansionist ambitions. In 1798, the French invaded and established the Helvetic Republic, centralizing the Swiss government. However, Swiss resistance and internal discord led to instability, and by 1803, Napoleon reintroduced a more decentralized system, the Act of Mediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Napoleon’s defeat, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 restored Swiss sovereignty and reinforced its policy of neutrality. Switzerland was declared a permanently neutral state, a status it has maintained ever since.\n",
